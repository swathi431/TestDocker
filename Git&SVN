git
*git is a distributed version control system, that means whole repository will be present in the local workspace.
*if you want to go to previous version of the code, it will be available in the local workspace.
*in git we can work offline(local workspace).
*git has many advanced features like fetch, revert, rebase..etc

other(svn):
*centralized version control systems, only the latest version of code will be there in the local workspace.
*if you want the previous version of the code, it needs to be checked out from the central repo.
*we need to interact with central repo frequently.
*we dont have direct commands to all these features
